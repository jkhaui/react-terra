# react-terra Quickstart

## Pre-requisites

While react-terra tries to be as simple and developer-friendly as possible, some 
assumptions are made about the individual (i.e. you) reading these docs:

- You are comfortable developing SPAs, specifically in React.
- You have at least a basic understanding of Rust, smart contracts, and the 
  Terra ecosystem.

Experience with Docker can be helpful, but it's not essential if you're 
capable of running a local Terra node without it.

## Clone the repo

Kickstart the process by running the following command:

```shell
npx ...
```

**TODO: WIP**
